# PVU-WeatherBoy
 Predict the probability of weather affecting your plants in PVU (PlantVSUndead)

If unsure about the weather, use *NULL* when asked for it.

## Required Packages:
In order to use the automatic weather fetcher you need to have *selenium* python package installed.
If it is not installed then you will be prompted to enter the weather manually. For ease of use I 
have included chromedriver.exe, if you dont feel comfortable, feel free to delete the one included 
and get chromedriver.exe from the official website: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/

## Current Features:
* Show probability of positive, negative and neutral weather tomorrow
* List the maximum impact, both positive and negative, that may occur
* List all the positive and negative effects that could occur
* Display the average of all possible weather effects
* Automatically fetch the weather data if possible
